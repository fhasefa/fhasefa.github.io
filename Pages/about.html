      <p class="p-about">
      My story starts in Saudi Arabia where I was born in 1993.
      I came to the Minneapolis in the dead of winter when I was 7
      years old. Literally from one dessert to another. In 2003, my
      family and I packed up and moved to Boston where I have
      lived since. Growing up in Boston was always a blessing to me because
      it allowed me the opportunity to be immersed in a forward thinking and
      culturally diverse environment. While being a major city, Boston still
      has the small-town charm most cities don’t have. Its clean, spacious,
      and you can see the sky from Downtown.
<br>
<br>Traveling around the world is what I am deeply passionate about.
I would love to be able to travel throughout the world getting the
opportunity to meet different people and their cultures. I would love to
try new foods while enjoying the scenery in places like Japan and Peru
has always been my dream.

      The videos above shows you just how rich and beautiful Peru is. That’s
      why it has always been at the top of my list of places to visit. I have
      also always wanted to visit Japan. Japan is full of tradition, but also
      is one of if not the most advanced and modern places in the world.
