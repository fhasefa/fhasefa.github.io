My name is Fitsum Asefa, but go by Fits for short.
I graduated from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2017
with a bachelors of science in bio-chemistry. I then went on
to work for a local distillery working my way up from front of
house services to head of operations of production and manufacturing.
I am currently enrolled in Per Scholas Software Engineering program
and excited to begin my journey into the tech world.
